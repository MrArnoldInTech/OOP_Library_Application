# OOP_Library_Application
This is a OOP project that involves reading a library from a text file into an application in Java

This application is expected to follow requirements that were set out by assignment requirements. 

- There are three types of items: Books, Movies, Journals.
- The Library will keep note of each item: type, id, title, year, average rating, nmumber of reviewers &
  max number of days for borrowing.

- Borrow Amounts are as follows: 28 days for books, 14 days journals and 7 days for movies.

- To note: if an item does become on loan, its due date needs to be recorded.

- Other information that should be recorded are a "record of author", and "number of pages" for books, "director" for the movies, and of course
need to include "volume & number" for journals.

Main Tasks for this application: 
- Program should be able to read directly from a text file and to split it by its type accordianly. This being "Movie", "Journal" and "Book".
- Should be able to print out the whole library when the application runs.
- The User should have a list of questions they can follow.
- "Search" items by "id" or "phrase in title" and to also list the items found
- "Select" an item from the list items that are displayed and display the details of that item.
- "Borrow" should appear for the user if the selected item is avaible, and to display the new due date
- "Return" the selected item if it is on loan or
- "Rate" the selected item and to which it should display the new averrage rating.
